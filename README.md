Add Recognition of Apple Magic Mouse 2 to Ubuntu Trusty

*** NOTE: These tools will NOT provide full touch support. The MM2 will still function as a basic 2-button mouse! ***
... but it WILL be using the hid_magicmouse module.

This works and is tested on Ubuntu Trusty (14.04) LTS but should work on most Debian-based distros and others with changes to the method of installing the kernel soyurce.

In order for the system to recognise the Apple Magic Mouse 2 as a Magic device, we need to ...

  1. Pair the Magic Mouse to the system using the usual Bluetooth methods.
  2. Add the new vendor_id and device_id to the modprobe config and the udev hwdb.
  3. Patch the current hid_magicmouse kernel module and hid-ids header to recognise the new vendor and device ids.
  4. Load (or reload) the hid_magicmouse module after the update.

After step 1, run "./magicmouse2_build.sh" to perform steps 2 through 4.

ToDo:

Figure out how to convince the mouse to enable touch features.
